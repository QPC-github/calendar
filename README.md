# calendar

A calendaring tool is now available for the W3C community for beta              
testing.                                          
                                                                                                                                    
At this point, we offer a NextCloud instance, open to all chairs and            
team contacts (use your W3C credentials).

You may create, share and publish calendars (i.e. make them public) for         
any group. The tool gives the ability to send invitations, serve ics files      
and enables calDAV subscriptions, to inform the group participants. It is       
also possible to embed a simple web view in any web page via an iframe.

Some user documentation shows how to start:                                     
https://w3c.github.io/Guide/meetings/calendar/help                              
                                                                                
Since all the information will be publicly available, make sure                 
you don't publish sensitive information about teleconference access             
directly in the events you create (you may use a URI to a protected             
page).                                                                          
                                                                                
We will gather your feedback and, if the beta test is successful,               
propose further usage such as automatic integration of a calendar               
(web view) in group pages.  

Please report any issue as a GH issue.
